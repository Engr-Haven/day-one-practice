      <h1>FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT GUIDE</h1>
      <p>
        Frontend development is the art and science of creating the visual and
        interactive parts of a website or web application that users engage with
        directly. It involves transforming design concepts into functional,
        responsive, and user-friendly interfaces using technologies like HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript. A solid frontend development guide helps developers
        understand core principles such as layout design, accessibility,
        performance optimization, and cross-browser compatibility. It also
        covers modern tools and frameworks like React, Vue, or Tailwind CSS that
        streamline development and enhance user experience. Whether you're a
        beginner or an experienced coder, mastering frontend development
        empowers you to build seamless, engaging digital experiences that bring
        ideas to life on the web.
